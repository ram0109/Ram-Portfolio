            <h2><u>UI/UX Design</u></h2>
            <p>UI/UX design refers to the process of creating user interfaces and experiences for digital products, such as websites, mobile apps,
                and software applications. UI (User Interface) design focuses on the visual elements, layout, and interactive components of a product,
                aiming to make it visually appealing and easy to navigate. This includes designing buttons, icons, menus, and other graphical elements.
        
                On the other hand, UX (User Experience) design is concerned with the overall usability and functionality of the product.
                It involves understanding user behavior, conducting research, and optimizing the design to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience for users.
                UX designers work to simplify processes, reduce friction, and anticipate user needs, thereby enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.</p>
